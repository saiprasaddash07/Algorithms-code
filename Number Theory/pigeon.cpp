    General statement
        If there are more pigeons than pigeonholes then there must be one pigeonhole with
        at least 2 pigeons in it.

    Theorem - 1
        If x = avg no of pigeons per hole ( x != integer)
        (i)  => At least one hole contains ceil(x) pigeons
        (ii) => Remaining holes contains at most floor(x) pigeons

    Theorem - 2
        Let q1,q2,q3,q4,.....,qn are +ve int.
        total no of objects = q1+....+qn-n+1
        total holes = n
        Then either 1st hole contains at least q1 objects
        .................................................
        .................................................
        .................................................
        .................................................
        or          nth hole contains at least qn objects
